# Import Notion Markdown plugin

This plugin allows you to import notes from Markdown files that are exported from [Notion.so](https://notion.so).

It is a fork of the [import-markdown](https://github.com/q1701/inkdrop-import-markdown) plugin, which is a fork of the [import-html](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-import-html).

Make sure to run `npm run dev` while hacking on this.
